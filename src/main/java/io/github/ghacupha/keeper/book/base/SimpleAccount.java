/**
 * Implements the {@link Account} interface and maintains states for {@link Currency}, {@link AccountDetails} and
 * {@link AccountSide}. The Currency and AccountDetails are final upon initialization, but the AccountSide remains
 * volatile, inorder to represent the changing nature of the account as the {@link Entry} items are added. This is
 * also assigned on initialization allowing the client to describe default {@link AccountSide} of the {@link Account}.
 *
 * @author edwin.njeru
 * Some non-guaranteed care has been taken to make the Implementation as thread-safe as possible. This may not
 * be obviously evident by the usual use of words like "synchronized" et al. In fact synchronization would probably just
 * slow us down. Instead what has been done is that the {@link Collection} of {@link Entry} items, which is the whole
 * concept of this Account pattern, has been implemented using a {@link List} interface implementation that creates a new
 * copy of itself every time time a mutative process is carried out. It's iterator as a result is guaranteed never to throw
 * {@code ConcurrentModificationException} and it does not reflect additions, removals or changes to the list, once they
 * have been created.
